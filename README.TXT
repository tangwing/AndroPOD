This is the project of the course OS. We create an application for a microchip named AndroPOD to control a robot. The main work is to study the API of AndroPOD and to understand the way of communication betweet our cellphone Android and the robot Lynxmotion. The code source is just about basic TCP communication, nothing complicated.

AndroPOD can be seen as a serial port for Android devices. It's just like a brige which allows you to send command from your Android phone to your serial equipments. You can find more information from this site : www.xdevelop.at

You can find a eclipse project named HelloAndropod,relative documentations are in the Documentation forder. 

Attention!The report and the presentation are in French! :P
